This guide teaches you how to define tasks and build workflows through practical examples.

## Learning Path

**[Basics](./basics/first-task)** — Start here

1. [Your First Task](./basics/first-task) — `@task` decorator and task IDs

**[Core Concepts](./core-concepts/task-instances)** — Master the fundamentals

5. [Task Instances](./core-concepts/task-instances) — Reusing tasks with different parameters
6. [Channels and Context](./core-concepts/channels-context) — Inter-task communication, injection, and prompt management
7. [Execution Patterns](./core-concepts/execution-patterns) — Getting results and controlling execution
8. [Complex Workflows](./core-concepts/complex-workflows) — Diamond patterns and multi-instance

**[Advanced Topics](./advanced/dynamic-tasks)** — Dynamic control flow

9. [Dynamic Task Generation](./advanced/dynamic-tasks) — Runtime task addition and control flow
